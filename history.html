    <p> Fnatic are one of the longest serving organizations in professional esports, having been founded in 2004 in London, England. In February 2021 Fnatic entered Valorant by picking up mix team SUMN FC. The successful European players joined the team Fnatic's first-ever VALORANT roster. 2022 started off great as their squad managed to secure 1st place in the 2022 EMEA Challengers. After a disappointing early exit in Champions 2022 in Istanbul and some roster changes the squad managed to lift a trophy after winning 2-0 against Acend in the Superdome tournament weeks later on Saturday 4th March 2023, FNATIC were officially crowned the first ever Valorant LOCK//IN Champions after battling it out with the most elite teams from across the world. A couple of months later, in June 2023, FNATIC is taking home yet another major Trophy from VCT Masters Tokyo. Back-To-Back, undefeated.
